# Reading files

The description asksus to redirect the input of `/challenge/read_me` to `PWN` variable and read it using `read`.
we have to use `<` to redirect input.

```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{8JMfOfEh4znR_CU1lPhsvf95qG3.dBjM4QDLwMjN0czW}
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$
```

This is how I solved it.
