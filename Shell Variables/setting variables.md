# Setting Variables

The description asks us assign the value of `COLLEGE` to `PWN`.
this can be done by using `=`.
We have to make sure that we don't leave space in between, otherwise the assignment will not happen.

```bash
muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{o0spfidBlacM75tjoef0MPjF_I-.dlTN1QDLwMjN0czW}
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$
```

This is how I solved it.
