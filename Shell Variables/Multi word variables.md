# Multi Word Variables

The description asks me to assign `COLLEGE YEAH` to `PWN`.
This can be done by double quoting the value we want to assign to the variable.
In this case the variable is `PWN` and value to be assigned `COLLEGE YEAH`.

```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{kMfNOrTVRr2cga4v-xfRHddqNDW.dBjN1QDLwMjN0czW}
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$
```

This is how I solved it.
