# Background Processes

The description asks me to suspend `/challenge/run` and launch another copy of it.
This can be done by firstly running the `/challenge/run` and then suspend it by using the hotkey `ctrl-Z`.
Then we have to use `bg` command to launch it's another copy in the background.

```bash
Connected!
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root         139 S+   bash /challenge/run
root         141 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the
background, and then launch a new version of me! You can background me with
Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if you're not ready to
do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ bg
[1]+ /challenge/run &



Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times
to scroll this text out.
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root         139 S    bash /challenge/run
root         149 S    sleep 6h
root         150 S+   bash /challenge/run
root         152 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

Yay, I found another version of me running in the background! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{cwi0VRcmv77epUpemtM_LXUS8mq.ddDN4QDLwMjN0czW}
hacker@processes~backgrounding-processes:~$
```

This is how I solved it.
After running the `bg` command it asks us to hit enter and run `/challenge/run` again to get the flag.
