# The roots

the description asks us to run the program `pwn` using its absolute path.

```bash
muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MM8zsGLGJh2wbXdOv2uAEUd4y5k.dhzN5QDLwMjN0czW}
```

This is how I solved it.

This shows how to access a directory.
