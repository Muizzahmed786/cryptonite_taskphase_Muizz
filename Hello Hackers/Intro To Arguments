# Intro To Arguments

The description asks us to run the `hello` command with a single argument of `hackers`.

```bash
muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4lSD0ae67OBUnxpXktqY5h3jC2f.dhjNyUDLwMjN0czW}
```
Arguments refer to the additional data we pass after the command.
here the command is `hello` and `hackers` is an argument.
