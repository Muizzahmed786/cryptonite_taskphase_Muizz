# intro to commands

The description asks me to enter `hello` to get the flag


```bash
muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8dKzaKU4WmyXPpeCl79HCxVCTNB.ddjNyUDLwMjN0czW}
```

This is how solved it.
