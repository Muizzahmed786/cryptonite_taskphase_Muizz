# intro to arguments

the description asks me to run command `hello` with a single argument of `hackers`


```bash
muizz@LAPTOP-VF1FT9IQ:~$ ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4lSD0ae67OBUnxpXktqY5h3jC2f.dhjNyUDLwMjN0czW}
```
this is how i solved it.

Arguments refer to the data we pass after the command.
here the command is `hello` and the argument is `hackers`
