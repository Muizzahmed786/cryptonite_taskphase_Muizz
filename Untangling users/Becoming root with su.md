# Becoming root with su

The description asks us to use `su` command and switch to `root` and read `/flag` to get the flag.

```bash
Connected!
hacker@users~becoming-root-with-su:~$ su
Password:
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# whoami
root
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# cat /flag
pwn.college{gxi4WWKtNJfaZoO9VbNoXj9Q1Xa.dVTN0UDLwMjN0czW}
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker#
```

This is how is solved it.
